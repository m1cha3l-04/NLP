    "\n",
    "> Tagging means the classification of tokens into predefined classes. **Parts of speech (POS)** tagging is the process of marking each word in the given corpus with a suitable token i.e. part of speech based on the context. It is also known as grammatical tagging."

    "### Techniques for POS tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are mainly four types of POS taggers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. **Rule-based taggers:** The rule-based taggers work on the basis of some pre-defined rules and the context of the information provided to them to assign a part of speech to a word.\n",
    "> 2. **Stochastic/Probabilistic taggers:** This is the simplest approach for POS tagging. It uses probability, frequency and statistics. These taggers find the tag which was most frequently used for a given word in the text under consideration in the training data and assign that tag to the word in the test data. Sometimes, this may result in tagging which is grammatically incorrect.\n",
    "> 3. **Memory-based taggers:** A collection of cases is kept in memory, each having a word, its context, and an appropriate tag. Based on the best match among the cases kept in memory, a new sentence is tagged.\n",
    "> 4. **Transformation-based taggers:** It is a combination of rule-based and stochastic tagging. In this type, the rules are automatically generated from the data. Also, some pre-defined rules are considered as well. Both these factors are used to perform POS tagging in transformation-based POS taggers.\n",
